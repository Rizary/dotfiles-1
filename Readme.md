# Dotfiles

This repository contains all of my personal configurations.  You can use my
configurations!  You'll probably want to create a new [machine
configuration](./machines) and symlink to it from
`/etc/nixos/configuration.nix`.

But in all probability, if you're looking at this, you won't want to use this
directly and instead will want to copy some of my configurations into your own.
